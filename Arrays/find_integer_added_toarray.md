# ðŸ“Œ LeetCode Problem 3131. Find the Integer Added to Array I
](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-integer-added-to-array-i/)

# **Problem statement:-You are given two arrays of equal length, nums1 and nums2.

**Each element in nums1 has been increased (or decreased in the case of negative) by an integer, represented by the variable x.**

**As a result, nums1 becomes equal to nums2. Two arrays are considered equal when they contain the same integers with the same frequencies.**

**Return the integer x.**

.

### Solution:-

``` java


class Solution {
    public int addedInteger(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
         Arrays.sort(nums1);
        Arrays.sort(nums2);
        int difference=nums2[0]-nums1[0];
        return difference;
    }
}
